# SpaceTrek_Java
This is a 2d game written as a Java Applet that I created in High School. It was originally going to be a game about space,
but I had trouble writing the AI for the ships, so I implemented a simple AI that moved them around randomly. I decided they were acting more like rabbits (wandering aimlessly) than ships and I created wolfs that were supposed to chase down the rabbits. Then I got distracted with actual school work and stopped developing this.

I'm leaving it up here because I want to have a record of where I came from, and I think it's interesting to see how I've changed. If I remember correctly, it still runs. 

## This project was worked on in 2012, when I was still in high school.
It's not indicative of my current programming proficiency.
